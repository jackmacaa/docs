__FILE__ : returns the dir of this file
__LINE__ : returns the line in text editor
__CLASS__ : returns class name
Variable variables :	$foo = "bar" , $$foo = "baz"    name of $$foo is bar
var_dump : to print and get var type
Ints : can have _ in between with no change e.g. 200_000 is 200000
<=> : returns -1 if below 0 if equal and 1 if above
break : jumps out of current layer of loop, break 2 will jump out of two layers
Do while : will run the code b4 checking the condition compare to while which only runs if condition is met
Loop efficiency :
  - Having the count function run in the for loop means its called every time
  - setting it to a variable or set in the first
  - part of the for loop would be better e.g. for($i = 0, $length = count($arr); $i < $length; i++)
foreach : the variable created in the foreach loop is not destroyed, is still a reference to the last element
option : to replace brackets with ":" and "endthing" e.g. while(condition)    endwhile;
include : will continue on with the code if is missing or error, where as require will stop
function declaration : Can set parameters of function e.g. foo(y":" $y, x":" $x)  will work on function foo($x, $y)
Static method : These can be called from the class without the need to create an instance of the class first
