Ticket gets assigned to you
You provide an estimate for how long you think it'll take (we use PERT, we'll get to that, just work with "it'll take Xhrs for now")
Assign that to the PM (Ben in almost all cases)
Move ticket to "Estimate to be approved"
The PM will assign back to you with "Approved" as the status when they've approved the estimate
You'll move it to "In Progress/Development"
...magic happens here___
Then you move it to "Code Review"
When the PR is approved by 2 people (in Tentworld it's 2, in others it's more or less)...you move it to "Ready for Staging"
When it gets merged, you move it to "Internal QA" and test the change in staging
If all good; move to "Done", if not; comment why and if you'll need more time (another estimate) and go back to the second point
